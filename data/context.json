  "definition": "Defining Data Justice for the Machine\n\nData Justice is a call to improve the governance of data. Data Governance means: Rules that determine data practices, which includes how – under which conditions, by which actors, and for what purpose - data are collected and produced, how they are processed and analyzed, and how they are used. This also involves thinking about the role data practices should play in our societies in general. Rules can be made formally and informally. This means they contain e.g. laws, recommendations, strategies, investments, and practices. Rules can be made on different levels of hierarchy (at different distances from the data practices) e.g., at the level of the European Union, the national federal government of Germany, the state governments of Germany.\n\nImprovements of Data Governance are necessary because data practices can create value and also harms. The benefits and harms are not distributed fairly throughout local societies and globally. In fact, the axes of distribution follow the same axes of exclusion and domination that have been present in our societies for a long time. These include: Race, gender, socio-economic status, ability/disability (and many more). Data Justice means these benefits are distributed equitably. Equitably means that data practices are designed specifically to benefit those members of society who are currently (and have historically been) burdened more with the harms and receive fewer benefits. Harm should be mitigated for all members of society. Data Justice also means that those members of society most impacted by data practices should be involved in making the rules of data governance on all levels, i.e. from European rule-making to the development and implementation of data practices in a local context. They should have a stronger voice. There are different ways to make Data Justice more concrete. This way, Data Justice can be used to examine how fair or equitable a country's Data Governance is.\n\nOne option are the 3 pillars of Data Justice and 5 principles for AI governance (Taylor). Each of the 3 pillars contains positive and negative rights that data governance systems should ensure.\n\n1. (In)Visibility: All people have a right to representation, e.g. in datasets as a basis to claim other fundamental rights and the right to be recognized as a person with a valuable cultural-historical identity. People also have the right to privacy, which includes the right to refuse the collection of data about oneself as well as the right to refuse being subjected to predictive profiling based-on other people’s data.\n2. (Dis)Engagement with data-based technologies: The right to benefit from using data or to share in the (economic) benefits derived from data practices and the right to retain autonomy regarding the engagement with data practices and data-based technologies, i.e., determining the terms and conditions of engagement with data practices, systems and markets. This underpins the freedom to determine one’s visibility.\n3. (Non)Discrimination: The right to be free from discrimination. This requires the power to identify (and challenge) instances of discrimination (being treated differently) as well as the ability to claim redress and/or preventative action. “How accountability for harms is to be enacted in practice should be the result of democratic deliberation rather than decided by those responsible for harms (or data handling).”\n\nThe 5 governance principles are as follows:\n1. Preserving public infrastructure and goods: At the conceptual stages of any tech development or deployment there must be mechanisms to assess the impact on public interest including a way for the public to debate what this interest is. This pertains also to foundational public infrastructures. To ensure this, there must be mechanisms for individuals and groups to contest the use of data practices and AI; this requires transparency/awareness of harms and the possibility make collective complaints to the deployer of the system. It is essential to find ways to incorporate democratic process into data governance, instead of leaving major decisions to standardization bodies or corporate self-regulation checks.\n2. Inclusiveness: The provisions and rights data governance entails shall not be limited to legal citizen status, or certain groups; instead, data governance should ensure equally realizable rights (i.e. capabilities) for all members of society that are impacted by data practices. Fundamentally, this requires a reconceptualization of how datafication renders people vulnerable; it is not inherent in the types of data collected but the result of historically emerged unequal distribution of power and agency.\n3. Contestability: The premises and legitimacy of data practices and AI use must be practically contestable on all levels, including questioning the role of data practices in society and current market logics. This requires accountability mechanisms that enable impacted members of society to actually make claims “If contestation is not possible for those in the most disadvantaged position, there is no meaningful contestability.”\n4. Global responsibility: Any governance model must be attentive to the “global standard setting” effects and avoid hypocrisy, e.g. allowing extraction of data from lower resource settings while still providing protection for their own citizens and data.\n5. Reorienting data governance towards justice: Taking the 3 pillars of data justice (see above) as guiding principles.\n\nAnother option is the 6 principles of Data Justice: Power, Equity, Access, Identity, Participation, Knowledge. Some important guiding questions that can be derived from those. Interrogation of data practices must start before the collection of any data, i.e., at the inception of a data system or data governance system. (Leslie et al)\n1. Does data governance enable or disable oppression? And does it preserve or combat harmful relations of power?’\n2. How does data governance address long-term patterns of structural inequality that shape data practices (on different scales)?\n3. Does data governance ensure that data practices and outcome metrics are aligned with community-centred goals?\n4. Does data governance address equitably opening access to data through responsible data sharing?\n5. Does data governance advance equitable access to research and innovation capacity?\n6. Does data governance advance equitable access to benefits of data works?\n7. Does data governance address the equitable distribution of the harms and benefits of data practices? (This is the dimension of distributive justice.)\n8. Does data governance examine and address the material preconditions necessary for the universal realisation of justice?\n9. Does data governance rectify the identity claims of those who have faced representational injury?\n10. Does data governance right the wrongs of the past so that justice can operate as a corrective dynamic in the present?\n11. Does data governance promote sharing of lived-experiences and injustices incl. by acting as a witness and providing tools to impacted members of society? This requires process, institutional and outcome transparency\n12. Does data governance acknowledge the social practice behind categorizing and prevent discriminatory forms?\n13. Does data governance resist the reification of identities as a convenience of computational sorting and optimisation, and contest the erasure of identities and the risk of intersectional harm from incomplete and mistargeted data practices?\n14. Does data governance ensure democratic mechanisms in data research and innovation? Are all people/groups that are affect by data practices involved and able to jointly decide: how data practices, data-based research and innovation are governed; for which purposes data practices should be pursued and for which it should not; and how justice should be integrated in the process?\n15. Does data governance see data subjects as relational rather than narrowly individualistic?\n16. Does data governance ensure equitable terms and modes of engagement and communitcation in decision making processes?\n17. Does data governance integrate diverse knowledges beyond technical and professional expertise?\n18. Does data governance prioritize interdisciplinarity?\n\nA third option is to examine data governance across the 5 domains of justice (Heeks) “Procedural: fairness in the way in which data is handled. Instrumental: fairness in the results of data being used. . Rights-based: adherence to basic data rights such as representation, privacy, access and ownership. . Structural: the degree to which the interests and power in wider society support fair outcomes in other forms of data justice. Distributive: an overarching dimension relating to the (in)equality of data-related outcomes that can be applied to each of the other dimensions of data justice."
