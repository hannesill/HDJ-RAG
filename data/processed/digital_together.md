for Health and Care


##### The Digitalisation Strategy for Health and Care – Tangible Benefits and Opportunities



REDUCED

­MORTALITY


_Cardiac insufficiency is the_
_most frequent reason for_
_inpatient hospitalisation_


Telemonitoring reduces
rehospitalisation and
­mortality rates among
­cardiac insufficiency
­patients.


REDUCING

­MISMEDICATION


_30 to 40 percent of people_
_over the age of 65 take_
_at least four types of medi­_
_cation per day; from age 75_

_one in three takes at least_

_eight different types of_

_medication_


Data from the electronic

patient record (elektronische
Patientenakte – ePA) can

assist automated medication

checks and help detect

medication-related risks.



REDUCED

­BUREAUCRATIC

EFFORT


_90 percent of nursing_
_staff feel overburdened_
_with ­bureaucracy_


Electronic documentation
simplifies work and saves
time, such as when inter­

connected monitoring
­systems document vital

­parameters.


EARLIER

DETECTION OF

COMPLICATIONS


_High blood sugar levels_
_and high blood pressure_
_can cause kidney damage_


Digitalisation helps to
­detect the risk of kidney
damage in diabetics at
an early stage.


FASTER DETECTION

OF RISKS


_During pregnancy, gestational_
_diabetes is diagnosed in ap­_
_proximately 5 of 100 women_


Through digitalisation

­available data can be used

to ensure that ­gestational

diabetes is treated earlier,
benefitting both mother

and child.


RELIEVING THE

­BURDEN ON

FAMILY CARERS


_78 percent of family carers_
_who care for people with_

_dementia are overburdened_

_both physically and in terms_
_of time_


Digital applications can
provide support in the
home for the purposes of
entertainment, monitoring

and ­reminders.



**Figure 1:** _The Added Value of Digitalisation for Patients and_
_Providers: Examples_


MINIMISING

EXPOSURE TO

RADIATION


_Cardiologists working in_

_­interventional medicine_

_have a greater risk of_
_­cancer from heightened_
_­exposure to radiation_


Robot-assisted coronary
­intervention systems
can result in a 95.2 percent
reduction in cardiologists’
­exposure to radiation
when performing surgical
operations.


MORE TIME

FOR ­PATIENTS


_55 percent of speech_
_­therapist practices with_
_therapeutic staff complain_
_about a shortage of skilled_

_workers_


The time saved in using

teleconsultations enables

more patients to be seen.


##### The Strategy’s Core ­Components – An Overview

Further development of the **telematics in­**


**frastructure** (TI) and especially the **electronic**


**patient record** (ePA) to create an **individual**


**healthcare platform** for insurance holders.


To enable the “ePA for all”, an **opt-out prin­**


**ciple** is being introduced. This means that


unless they object, all insurance holders will


receive an ePA.


“By 2025, 80 percent of statutory insurance


holders will have an electronic patient record


(ePA).”







Telemedicine will be expanded to enable


low-threshold access to healthcare. For this


purpose, **specialist-assisted telemedicine**


**services** will be introduced which can be taken


up, for example, in **pharmacies and health**


**kiosk** **(Gesundheitskioske)** . In addition, the


existing 30 percent restriction on telemedicine


services for physicians and general practi­


tioners will be lifted.


“By 2026 there will be an assisted telemedicine


access point in at least 60 percent of regions

with insufficient access to general practi­


tioners.”












Focus will be placed on **digital transformation**


**of healthcare processes** rather than on simple


digitalisation of documents. As part of this


process, indication-related, **digitally assisted**


**and digitalised disease management pro­**


**grammes** (dDMPs) will be established. In


addition, information will be shared via secure


digital communication channels using the TI.


“In 2026, 80 percent of communication pro­


cesses in healthcare will be paperless.”


The **research data landscape will be under­**


**pinned with healthcare data** – the link­


age of existing data silos will be enabled by


­successive introduction of a research


­pseudonym. This opens the door to all kinds

of research for the benefit of both patients


and the common good.


“By the end of 2026, no less than 300 research


projects will be conducted or initiated using


data from the Health Data Lab (FDZ).”



5


**Gematik GmbH** will be transformed into a


**digital health agency** which prioritises user


orientation: The digital health agency will be


responsible for digitalisation of end-to-end


processes and charged with drawing up


comprehensive **interoperability** requirements.


Positive user experience with TI applications


will be a prerequisite for the approval of


such applications. In addition, the agency’s


**autonomy** will be strengthened by reorgan­


ising the governance structure.


Foreword


When it comes to health and care in Germany, digitalisation carries huge


­potential that has hardly been used to date. This is why digitalisation is a key


issue in this current legislative period. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown

that digitalisation offers tangible benefit that enables successful, effective


transformation: For example, during that time, the number of video consultations

held increased significantly, while long-term care counselling and advice was


digitalised and provided online. With the Corona-Warn-App (CWA) and the digital

vaccination certificate, vast numbers of people used a health app on their

smartphones for the first time.


The Digitalisation Strategy is to be seen as a compass to guide the actions


performed by all stakeholders right now as well as in the upcoming years.


Against this backdrop, it sets out short-term, medium-term and long-term

measures for three separate fields of action. It also helps in striking a reasonable


balance between value-generating use of health and care data and compliance


with data privacy and data protection provisions.


Three examples:


� In many cases, the type of healthcare a person receives is still too often


a matter of chance. If more digitally assisted healthcare programmes were


available to offer patients guidance and orientation, healthcare provision


could be made more personalised as well as its quality improved. Accord­


ingly, for example, in rural regions telemedicine and digitalised disease


management programmes will provide better access to better quality


healthcare.


�
Use of health and care data enables significant improvements in healthcare


and research. For this reason, health and care data will be removed from


existing data silos and linked to form a new health data space for research.


� The electronic patient record (ePA) will evolve into a digital healthcare


platform. As a central application, it connects all relevant stakeholders in

everyday healthcare provision. This ensures optimal flow of information


between the various healthcare providers and patients, and the secure use

of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence and digital twins.


This Digitalisation Strategy for Health and Care was developed in collaboration


with numerous representatives from the medical and pharmaceutical community,


the healthcare, nursing and long-term care system, patients, people in need of


long-term care, health insurance and long-term care insurance funds and other


cost carriers, science and research, and the industrial healthcare economy. Rather


than being simply a programme devised by the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG),


it is designed as a guide for the joint effort of all stakeholders concerned. So now,


with all of this in mind, let us get to work!

##### 1. Our Vision and Aim


Digitalisation in health and care enables healthier and


longer lives for all. It also improves the quality of


healthcare, making it more efficient.



Digitalisation is essential in improving health and care.
Given the right conditions, it provides for better quality in
preventive healthcare, diagnostics, medical treatment and
care, therapy and support. It enables more flexible provi­
sion of healthcare and long-term care for all, independent
of geographical location, and relieves the bureaucratic bur­
den placed on medical and nursing staff in their daily work.


In combination with the German Federal Government’s

National Digitalisation Strategy, the Digitalisation Strategy
for Health and Care plots a clear course of action. It sets
out a vision of a resilient, future-proof, sustainable and
digitally assisted health and care system, and provides
guidelines on how to achieve it. The Strategy provides all
stakeholders with a transparent guideline. It contains
­verifiable goals and objectives, will be evaluated regularly,
and updated continuously.
Digital transformation of health and care serves in enabling
people in Germany to lead healthy, good and long lives.
In doing so, an eye is kept to the European dimension of
cross-border healthcare provision.
The aim is to achieve the best-possible mix of digital and
analogue components of people-centric healthcare:


� Stakeholders are closely interconnected and interact
via beneficial digital technologies and applications. In
a digital healthcare ecosystem, healthcare providers,
health insurance funds, long-term care insurance funds

and other cost carriers as well as the industrial healthcare

economy work hand in hand, exchanging health infor­
mation and data as part of the healthcare process. Digital
connectivity is closely related with increasing institu­
tional connectivity between the various stakeholders in
health and care. It, thereby, enables partnership-based
cooperation across healthcare sectors and professions.



� As a learning system, the health and care system will
be developed involving active use of healthcare data,
thereby enabling optimal use of digitalisation potential.
In addition to providing the best-possible treatment
and medical aftercare, preventive health maintenance
and preventing the need for long-term care are of vital
importance.
� Patients can easily access and understand health related
information, enabling them to better avoid illness and
its consequences, and thus make informed decisions

about treatment.

� Patients’ health and care data should be able to be used

for health policy management and research purposes,
thereby serving further improvement of healthcare.
� Innovative, secure technologies can give rise to rapid,
widespread benefits in the health and care context.
Healthcare provision and administration processes as
well as their associated structures will be continuously
transformed in line with available digital solutions.
� The healthcare provision process should be seamlessly
structured for patients and for healthcare and social
welfare professions. The relevant data and information
are available, thereby generating added value in health­
care provision.


##### Vision 2030: The Digital Health Ecosystem


**Figure 2:** _Vison 2030: A People-Centric_
_­Digital Ecosystem for Health and Care_


Digitalisation should also contribute to greater economic,
environmental and social sustainability in health and care.


The Digitalisation Strategy creates the conditions for con­
sistently people-centric, digitally assisted healthcare,
­nursing and long-term care provision that offers noticeable
benefit. Strengthening the digital health literacy and skills
of all stakeholders is thus a key prerequisite in ensuring
that digital services and applications are used.



Depending on their situation, people adopt various roles:
as healthy or sick individuals, as persons in need of longterm care, family members, or representatives from health­
care and social welfare professions, such as doctors, nurses

or midwives.


The Strategy thus has the following overarching goals and
objectives:



CONSEQUENT FOCUS ON PEOPLE, PATIENT SOVEREIGNTY

AND ENTHUSIASM


We focus on peoples’ needs by:


� Using digitalisation to enable equitable, comprehensive, non-­
discriminatory and affordable access to healthcare, nursing and
long-term care provision for all.
� Making health and care data available as the basis for timely and
tailored provision of services and treatment, also making data
­directly available to patients to allow them to take self-determined,
informed decisions on the treatment they receive. This is a key
­component in strengthening patient sovereignty.
� Using digitalisation to provide the best-possible treatment and care
in all healthcare situations, thereby focusing on individual needs to
enable participation for all.
� Using digitalisation to create both better regulatory and working
conditions for healthcare, nursing and long-term care employees,
thereby relieving their everyday burden and saving time that can
be used for patient care. This helps to make healthcare and social
welfare professions a more attractive employment choice.

�
Taking a benefit-oriented approach to digital transformation, creating
tangible added value for stakeholders and fostering greater enthusi­
asm and acceptance.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE


The Digitalisation Strategy makes a key contribution towards improving
the quality of healthcare:


� Diagnostics, treatment, health and care are improved via consistent
use of data and digitally optimised processes, and needs-based use
of digital applications.
� Diseases, their effects and the need (or an increased need) for longterm care are detected earlier and largely prevented by means of
timely intervention.
� The provision of high-quality and needs-based healthcare is promoted
and guaranteed – both in urban centres and rural regions.
� The potential for general and personalised health and care risks can
be identified more quickly, allowing timely action to be taken, for
example with targeted treatment of diseases such as cancer and in
combating pandemic disease.

� Healthcare data is made more accessible for and used in research to

improve prevention, healthcare, nursing and long-term care, and
also after-care provision.


For 94 percent of respondents in the online survey,
it is important that the Digitalisation Strategy leads
to **higher quality outcomes** in healthcare.


### 94%

INCREASED COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY



(N=395)



(N=394)
### 85%


More than 85 percent of respondents
in the online survey see increased
**cost-effectiveness and efficiency** in
healthcare as an important objective
for the Digitalisation Strategy.



Digitalisation can make health and care more cost-effective and efficient by:


� Using high-quality health and care data facilitates the development of more
­efficient, more customised and more integrated healthcare provision and man­

agement programmes.
� Preventing diseases, their effects and the need (or an increased need) for longterm care as well as avoiding associated costs.
� Relieving the burden on medical and nursing staff in their everyday work, thereby
improving the working conditions.


To achieve these goals, when designing the digital transformation of the health and
care system, three central fields of action were identified as equally important:


**1.** Establishment of people-centric, digitally assisted cross-sectoral and cross
professional healthcare processes
**2.** Generation and use of high-quality data for better healthcare and research
**3.** Use of benefit-oriented technologies and applications


The fields of action are described in more detail in Section 2. Achieving these goals
and implementing the measures in the respective fields of action depend on:


� Greater patient sovereignty that enables informed, self-determined action and
decision-making for all patients and their relatives, and also takes account of
healthcare service providers’ needs.
� A suitable regulatory framework.
� A transparent, clear division of responsibilities and roles, as well as the provision
of an adequate governance framework for strategy implementation.
� Strict implementation management that includes all relevant stakeholders.


These issues are addressed in more detail in Sections 3 and 6. Figure 3 gives an
­overview of the Digitalisation Strategy’s components.

##### Strategic Fields of Action


##### **2.**


To achieve the digital transformation of health and care,
new approaches are needed in healthcare processes along
with the generation and use of health and care data, and
use of innovative digital technologies and applications.
This section sets out goals and objectives, strategic guide­
lines and short-term, mid-term and long-term measures
for those fields of action. These serve as a compass to
provide guidance for all stakeholders in health and care.
They also plot the course in designing the digital trans­

formation.


#### 2.1 Establishment of people-centric,

digitally assisted, cross-sectoral and
cross-professional **healthcare processes**


I. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES


Through wider use of digital resources, healthcare provision
and management processes are ­improved and redesigned.
Against this backdrop, the aim of the Digitalisation Strategy
is to establish needs-based, efficient processes which ensure
optimal digital assistance and support. To ensure that the
regulatory framework does not hinder good new processes,
suitable mechanisms will be developed for use in process

transformation.


###### Process Transformation ­Driven by Digitalisation






**This leads to the following objectives:**


**1.** Digitally assisted and purely analogue healthcare

­processes should initially be used on an equal footing
if they are equally suitable and produce equivalent
­results. Duplication is to be avoided. The principle of

cost-effectiveness must be taken into account.

**2.** Healthcare provision and administration processes will

be digitalised. In all life situations, patients should
­benefit from digitally assisted healthcare provision and
administration processes, including where they have
only limited digital literacy skills. Appropriate arrange­
ments will be made for insurance holders with special

needs.

**3.** Healthcare processes should be planned from the

­perspective of the recipient. The needs of the provider
(in terms of user-friendliness and data security, for
­example) must also be taken into account. Digitally
­assisted processes should be developed with the par­
ticipation of both groups.
**4.** To ensure optimal use of digital solutions, digital

healthcare and digital transformation literacy of all
stakeholders will be enhanced and the necessary
­training and instruction provided.


II. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES


To ensure that transformation is designed with those affected
in mind, digitalisation measures taken in health and care
will follow the guidelines listed below:

� Existing processes will be reviewed for their digitalisation
potential and adapted if needed. In transformation
management, the practice perspective plays an important
role. Available resources and capacities will be consid­
ered and prioritised.
� In designing the digital transformation, standardised
mechanisms should be developed and implemented to
enable digitally assisted healthcare provision, including

across national borders and between healthcare sectors,

and thus eliminate duplicate structures.
� In implementing the transformation, knowledge must
be promoted among all stakeholders through



21


wide-ranging healthcare communication measures.
This applies in particular to reliable information on the
benefits of digitalisation and self-determined use of
the resources it provides. As part of that process, both
citizens’ and service providers’ digital health literacy is

to be enhanced.

� Processes are to be updated and redesigned where
needed, to better utilise the potential offered by digitali­
sation – not least to improve the underlying processes
for the benefit of those involved. Where digitalisation
effects a change in existing processes, which can add
value for those involved or for healthcare provision,
those changes should be implemented. Merely trans­
ferring analogue processes or paper forms into digital
formats is not sufficient.




III. MEASURES


**Short-term**


� Design of model digitally assisted healthcare processes
(starting with disease management programmes,
DMPs) with integral digital components such as digital
health applications (DiGAs) and electronic patient
­records (ePAs).

� In the second quarter of 2023, a messenger service will

be launched for communication between service

­providers. A service for communication between service
providers and insurance holders will follow in 2024.
� Planning of a digitally assisted medication management
system: By the end of 2025, 80 percent of ePA users who
take at least one type of medication will have a digital

medication overview.

� Low-threshold telemedicine services will be made

available to insurance holders. Their take-up by users
and their provision by non-medical health professionals,
for example in pharmacies and health kiosks (Gesund­
heitskioske) will be assisted. By 2026, at least 60 percent
of regions with insufficient access to general practitioners
will have an assisted telemedicine access point.
� To improve usability of potential digital solutions in
long-term care, a Competence Centre Digitalisation
and Care will be established to identify and spread the
potential for improving and strengthening long-term
care provision for patients and carers. Funding provisions
for long-term care facilities will be expanded to promote
implementation of digital solutions.
� To simplify the search for the right long-term care
­programmes along with support and advisory services,
a dedicated information portal for long-term care and
support services will be set up and operated to serve
those in need of care, family caregivers, family members,
social welfare staff in hospitals, and in counselling and

advice centres.



**Medium-term**


� Other digitally assisted healthcare processes will
be successively developed and gradually rolled out.
In 2026, 80 percent of communication processes in
health and care will be paperless.
� For routine treatment of complex health issues, the

­relevant core information from the ePA will be made

available in the form of customised “partial summaries”
(such as a summary for diabetes or an oncological
­summary).
� The messenger service will be enabled to transmit
structured information (such as for ordering follow-on
prescriptions).
� Data for the ePA and the electronic medication plan
(eMP) will be provided via the e-prescription service.
� The aim is that by the third quarter of 2026, 60 percent
of public health service offices funded by the Federal

Government under the “Pact for the Public Health

­Service” improve their digital maturity by at least two
levels in at least three categories (in line with the digital
maturity model for public health offices).
� The aim is that by the end of 2025, 50 percent of hospi­

tals funded under the Krankenhauszukunftsfonds

­(Future Hospitals Fund) improve their digital maturity
by at least two levels in at least two categories (in line
with the DigitalRadar maturity model).
� Use of electronic real-time reporting processes by all
medical facilities and by public health authorities will
be mandatory.
� Work towards establishing suitable continuous training
programmes along with opportunities for dialogue
and exchange, especially for healthcare providers. In
the course of vocational training reforms for healthcare
­professions, acquisition of digital skills will continue

to receive ­consideration.


**Long-term**


� Healthcare, nursing and long-term care is increasingly
based on digital data and its provision is personalised
and tailored. On the basis of a population-based
data analysis, ­personalised preventive healthcare pro­
grammes will be made available.


### 96%(N=448)

96 percent of respondents in the online survey see the


**Small changes can make daily life easier and reduce risk**
**for patients and carers: Some examples**


In residential care homes, nursing staff is often faced with
the challenge of not allowing elderly residents at risk of
falling to get out of bed on their own. By the time they
have reached the light switch to go to the toilet, they could
already have tripped and hurt themselves. One care home
has developed a system which is designed to minimise
this risk in a simplistic, easy to implement way. Movement



amount of health and care data has been generated in the
course of healthcare provision over the past years. Digital
applications should make the data more usable to enable
personalised decisions concerning healthcare provision,
­increase patient safety, ensure people are better informed,
drive data-based healthcare policy-making and generate
new knowledge from research to improve healthcare.
In turn, new research results should be incorporated into
healthcare provision in a timely manner as part of a learning
system. The Digitalisation Strategy forms the basis for
­connecting the German healthcare and long-term care
system to the future European Health Data Space (EHDS)
and enabling cross-border healthcare and research.



23




**In the data field of action, the following and ­objectives**
**apply:**


**1.** The quality of health and care data generated during

treatment and care should be successively improved,

and the use of data facilitated.

**2.** Provide insurance holders with direct, secure access to


their personal health and care data and also use it in a
low-threshold manner to support and improve person­
alised treatment and care. This includes the right of pa­
tients to easily view their personal data, including with
help from others.
**3.** Each and every individual has the opportunity to decide

independently and without restriction on how their
personal treatment, health and care data is used. This
also enables informed decision-making about non-use
and its consequences, for example in the context of
the ­electronic patient record (ePA).
**4.** Ensure the availability and possible linkage of data

from various sources. This includes billing data, health­
care data from the ePA as well as study-related,
genomic and/or registry data. It also fosters acquisition
of knowledge on combating health risks such as pan­
demics, enables preventive and predictive action by
means of personalised medical treatment and care, and
takes the research data landscape to a new level. This
increases patient safety, the quality of treatment and
care, and also efficiency in the use of resources in health­
care, nursing and long-term care as well as the public
health service. By facilitating secure access to data for
research in both the public and private sector, Germany’s
role as a leading science and industry will be further

consolidated.

**5.** Promote the provision of representative data for research

and the development and use of data-driven technolo­
gies to provide more targeted support for provision and
administration processes in health and care, and place
greater focus on people in research, development and
application. For example, personalised treatment and
care is facilitated by using AI to assist early detection of
disease and, through early identification of complications
in the course of healthcare, nursing and long-term care.



II. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES


**To achieve these objectives, all action taken will comply**
**with the guidelines set out below:**


� Promote acceptance of and awareness for healthcare
data use and improve data literacy skills among doctors,
other healthcare providers and patients.
� Work towards harmonised interpretation of national and
EU data protection legislation for the healthcare sector,
and borrow from best practices implemented in other
EU Member States. With regard to provisions on data
use, data privacy and data protection, strike a balance

between the various interests and work towards har­

monised ­design and application of data protection law
to ensure data protection practice that enables appro­
priate data use. This includes balancing the state’s re­
sponsibility to protect its citizens with citizens’
self-responsibility and patients’ sovereignty.
� All insurance holders receive an electronic patient
­record (ePA) which accompanies them throughout their
lives. Its voluntary use is ensured by an opt-out provision
and clause. When providing treatment and care, the

health and care data stored in the ePA is ­accessed,

­relevant new data is added with minimum ­effort, and –

unless the patient has used the opt-out clause – is
made available for research in a data protection-com­
pliant form via the Health Data Lab (FDZ).
� For patients, the ePA will become the central platform
for matters concerning their health, treatment and
care. They receive information related to their personal
data, such as details of diagnoses and treatment options,

and associated reminders and medical advice. Data

concerning treatments and the use of digital healthcare
and long-term care apps (DiGAs/DiPAs) is automatically
transferred to the ePA and subsequently made available

for research.

� For healthcare providers, the ePA will become an
­essential component of healthcare processes. It contains
reliable information and assists in the provision of
treatment and care – for example, relevant data is high­
lighted and can be called up in a targeted search.


25



�
For the benefit of patients, as part of the model project
on genome sequencing under Article 64e of Book V
of the German Social Code, genomic medicine will be
strengthened as a knowledge-generating form of health­
care. Data should be easily accessible and reusable, ideally
in real time. There is no maximum storage period for
data in cases where longer storage periods make sense
in relation to medical treatment and care, and/or are

required for research. The availability of structured data
in the healthcare process will be continuously improved.
� In compliance with FAIR principles, the availability of

structured health and care data will be ensured for use

in the ePA and for systemic improvements through

­research.

� Lasting structures for medical registers will be promoted
to facilitate better availability of register data for health­
care provision and research, and for linkage with other
data. Existing initiatives on specific illnesses and health­
care-related medical registers, such as the establishment
of a German Implant Register (IRD) will continue.

� Data infrastructures will be harmonised and interfaced

by means of binding interoperability requirements and
via the use of internationally recognised standards.
Data from healthcare, from registers and studies will

be combined via an interconnected healthcare data

­infrastructure, enabling overarching, cross-source analy­
ses. Transparency regarding data storage sites will be
ensured and duplicate structures eliminated. The data
will be made accessible on the basis of purpose and
need via secure data processing environments.

�
The definition of datasets and data models takes re­
quirements for uniform, unbureaucratic medical and care
documentation into account. Duplicate documentation

is avoided.

� The creation of test and training datasets for algorithms
(e.g. AI) is facilitated so they can be used for the
­respective target groups in a non-discriminatory way.
Potential areas of application include interpreting
­medical images (such as X-rays and CT scans), observa­
tion of the human body and physiological processes
for the purpose of early detection and monitoring of
disease, after-care following surgical interventions,
identifying similarly complex cases in large datasets











**Figure 5:** _­Quality criteria for data_


(especially using genomic data and in personalised
medicine), and the detection of epidemiological risks
(such as the occurrence and development of pandemics).
� All service providers and their contracted software
­providers supply data in standardised, structured and
interoperable form in accordance with internationally
accepted standards and nationally defined specifications.
This also applies for all other institutions that generate
healthcare and long-term care data.
� Connectivity with projects and programmes in other
government departments (such as the Federal Govern­
ment’s Data Strategy) and within the EU is ensured
(primary and secondary data use in the EHDS).


III. MEASURES


**Short-term**


� The research data landscape will be underpinned by
the gradual introduction of a research pseudonym in
healthcare-related registers as well as routine and
study-specific data to enable linkage between health
and care research. In the medium-term, the research

pseudonym should also enable linkage with electronic
patient record (ePA) data.
� To improve public health and public health research, a
Federal Institute of Public Health (Bundesinstitut für
Öffentliche Gesundheit) will be established. The Insti­

tute will receive access to public health-related data
from the various interconnected data sources, thereby
making an important contribution to data-based deci­
sion-making on health policy concerns.
� Standardised and transparent division of responsibilities
and roles in respect of interoperability issues in health
and care. Moving away from system- and sector-specific
rules and regulations for interoperability and standardi­

sation.

� A right to interoperability and data portability will be en­
shrined in law and gradually implemented into practice.
� Implementation of medical information objects (MIOs)
which generate valuable healthcare benefits for a large
section of the population (e.g. medication data) will be
prioritised, thereby creating the foundation for harmonised
availability and usability in practice. In both the short-term
and medium-term, DMP datasets will be developed and
established as MIOs (see the processes field of action).
� Initiate a paradigm shift towards enabling access to data
via secure processing environments for specifically de­
fined purposes, especially for medical science research,

as data access authorisation criteria.

� Improve opportunities for health and long-term care

insurance funds and other cost carriers, and also asso­

ciations of SHI physicians to use – in the interests of

insurance holders – available health and care data to
identify regional healthcare needs and deficits, design
demand-based provision and conduct accompanying

research.



� With further development of the leading data protection
supervisory authority, a standardised data protection
supervision practice in health and care will be promot­
ed – with the goal of making use of data for healthcare
research purposes safe and applicable.
� Working towards standardisation of digital documenta­
tion in care (SGB XI). An assessment will also be made

to see if the interoperability of care documentation can
be improved (syntactically and semantically interoperable
data formats) and to identify the conditions that would
need to be put in place (such as standardised healthcare
terminology and classification systems).

�
For the benefit of patients, initially those with oncolog­
ical and rare diseases, and as part of the model project
on genome sequencing according to Article 64e SGB V,
enable genomic medicine as a knowledge-generating
form of healthcare and evaluate its use/benefits in
practice. Monitor connectivity with relevant registers,
the ePA, EU initiatives (1+ million genomes/Genomic
Data Infrastructure) and the interface with the Europe­
an Health Data Space (EHDS).
� The German Implant Register will initially go into oper­
ation to register breast implants.


**Medium-term**


� Establish a national access point for healthcare data as
a touch point for stakeholders from research and the
public health service to link health and care data from
multiple sources (ePA, routine data, study-related data,
etc.).

� By the end of 2026, no less than 300 research projects
will be conducted or initiated using data from the
Health Data Lab (FDZ).

� Gradual development towards achieving the realm
of the ideal in real-time availability of health and care
data. Work towards ensuring that ­selected routine data
from SHI healthcare provision is transferred to the ePA

and to the Health Data Lab in a structured format and

on a monthly basis at minimum. Service providers will
be required to meet appropriate deadlines.

� Drive harmonisation and standardisation of IT infra­

structures and an across-the-board increase of the


­digital maturity level of healthcare and long-term care
institutions – especially among healthcare providers
not previously in the focus of digitalisation activities
(such as physiotherapy/rehab).
� Create rules and regulations for secure use of health
and care data in AI testing and training. The EU legal
framework as well as prevailing national, EU and inter­

national initiatives will be taken into account.

�
In a first phase, certain data from all Länder-specific
cancer registers nationwide will be compiled by the
German Centre for Cancer Registry Data (ZfKD) at the
Robert Koch Institute. In a second phase, all cancer
register data should be compiled as needed, linked with
other data via a common platform and made accessible.
Transparency regarding data storage sites will be ensured
and duplicate structures dismantled.
� Following successful evaluation of the model project
on genome sequencing according to Article 64e SGB V,
its integration into standard healthcare provision will
be enabled and an assessment made regarding its
­expansion to other indications and datasets for person­
alised medicine. This also ensures connectivity with

other ­national and EU data infrastructures.

� Operation of the German Implant Register (IRD) will
be expanded to cover endoprostheses and aortic valves.


**Long-term**


� Technical and organisational infrastructures will be
­expanded to ensure that access to health and care data
is available for healthcare provision and research across

EU borders.

� With the model project on genome sequencing accord­
ing to Article 64e SGB V, a sustainable structure for
personalised medicine is created – among other things
for use by various omics datasets in healthcare provision

and research.

� Operation of the German Implant Register (IRD) will
be expanded to cover implant types.

86 percent of respondents in the online survey
believe that **faster and more secure exchange of**
**patient data** will improve the quality of health­
care, nursing and long-term care, and make it
more benefit focused. (N=441)


**Learning from other countries**
Access to relevant, centrally stored healthcare data for all
citizens and healthcare providers improves the quality of
healthcare provided and helps secure better results. Finland
began storing the medical data of all its citizens on a central
portal (Kanta) about 20 years ago. Using a password,
­insurance holders can log on to the secure portal at any
time from wherever they may be. Via the portal, they can
view authorisations and results, order prescriptions and
upload personal data, such as from fitness or activity track­
ers. With patients’ approval, healthcare providers can
quickly and easily view the relevant healthcare data with a

minimum of effort involved. This enables better and more

targeted medical care. The Finnish healthcare system re­
quires that healthcare providers use the database. Secondary
use of data is regulated by an opt-out process: Patients
can object to their data being used for research purposes
at any time. The data made available is used for various
kinds of studies, such studies to improve the treatment of

cancer and diabetes.


**AI assists in language assessment for early diagnosis of**
**neurodegenerative diseases.**
AI can process a large amount of speech data quickly and
efficiently. Melodic aspects of speech are taken into account.
Changes can be used as a kind of digital biomarker, which
the AI programme, uses to detect disease-related changes
in speech. AI can detect abnormalities at a very early stage
and at a level which without technical equipment, would

be undetectable to the human ear. [1]

#### 2.3 Benefit-oriented technologies

and **applications**


I. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES


The number of digital applications in use continues to grow,
including in health and care. To accelerate their integration
into everyday healthcare provision, the following objectives
apply:
**1.** The electronic patient record (ePA) will evolve into a

platform on which structured data can be stored and
used to provide value added services (such as checks
for medication interactions).

**2.** The telematics infrastructure (TI) and its applications

will be continuously developed and enhanced as the
underlying infrastructure for digitally assisted provision
and communication processes in health and care. Via
the TI, digital applications are interconnected in such
a way that data can be exchanged in a structured, secure,
timely approach across disciplines, facilities and sectors.
**3.** Digital innovations which are proven to be benefit-­

inducing and efficiency-enhancing are identified. The
necessary conditions are created to ensure that those
applications are integrated in a timely manner into

health and care.

**4.** Acceptance of digital applications among users is fos­

tered by providing transparency and by facilitating their
early inclusion and participation.


Use of innovative technologies is always in line with the
goals and objectives set out in the Digitalisation Strategy,
thereby helping to ensure longer, healthier lives, making
healthcare people-centric and stabilising funding for

health and care.


II. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES


To achieve these objectives, the measures taken in the
coming years will comply with the guidelines set out

­below:


� The electronic patient record (ePA) will be evolve and
become an integrated, individual digital healthcare
platform for insurance holders and, in combination with
other applications, become the standard in healthcare

provision:

� By 2025 80 percent of statutory insurance holders

will have an ePA. An associated opt-out provision

will be introduced.

� The ePA will be further developed and enhanced to


serve as the foundation for data-based value added

applications. People in Germany should be supported
in all matters concerning their personal health.
Access to the ePA occurs via a digital identity and

via mobile devices, both for insurance holders and

service providers.


� The data stored on the individual digital healthcare
platform is accessible for specific software programmes.
For example, interactions, abnormal laboratory results,
reminders for follow-on prescriptions and other healthrelated notifications can be automatically displayed.
Healthcare providers should also be able to obtain evalu­
ation reports (for example to detect changes in a patient’s
health status since they were last seen). Secure and
practicable encryption processes must therefore be used.


� The TI and its applications facilitate connectivity of and

between all stakeholders in health and care.


� Through mandatory connection of all service providers

with the TI and broad-based, regular use of its appli­

cations and services, the TI ensures the creation of a

secure digital healthcare ecosystem.

�
As part of the digital transformation, the specifications

are provided and the requirements for the interoper­
ability, user-friendliness and cost-effectiveness of
applications are set out. Application development
takes place on a competitive basis.



29


� The TI approach will be further developed as part

of an ongoing process and in line with technical and
legal developments and trends. The existing hard­
ware-based connectivity (via TI client hardware) will
be updated in line with the times. Applications sur­
rounding the TI and its use should be particularly
­user-oriented. These will be carefully selected, devel­
oped and subject to ongoing evaluation, using a
participative approach from the outset. Using a model
for technology evaluation from the user perspective,
the potential of digital healthcare technologies can
be estimated in early development phases.

� All stakeholders in the TI environment must meet


binding interoperability and IT security requirements.
� Digital applications, such as digital healthcare and

long-term care apps (DiGAs/DiPAs), telemedicine/
telecare solutions, digital aids and digital measures
to improve the home environment will be better
connected in the interests of providing interoperable,
digitally assisted healthcare and long-term care.


III. MEASURES


**Short-term**


� A Digital Health Agency will be established as the au­
thoritative body for digital applications in the German
health and care system, especially with regard to the
telematics infrastructure. When identifying and formu­
lating the requirements for appropriate ­applications,
users are to be involved at an early stage.
� Lifting of the restriction on telemedicine to 30 percent
of consultations and the establishment of performant
structures and services enable the potential of tele­
medicine to develop and unfold.
� Digital healthcare and long-term care apps (DiGAs
and DiPAs) will be developed as integral components
of digitally assisted healthcare processes. In the future,
DiGAs and DiPAs can not only export data to the ePA
(opt-out), but can also read data from the ePA where it
is necessary and useful for DiGA/DiPA personalisation.

�
The DiGA approach will be extended to beneficial
­digital medical devices in risk class IIb.


� In the future, DiGAs will be able to include detailed

telemedicine treatment plans with doctors’ involvement.
� Use of secure, cloud-based systems in outpatient and
inpatient healthcare and long-term care facilities as
well as for TI applications will be simplified – among
other things, by adapting the regulatory framework.

� In mid-2023, the technical conditions for nationwide use

of the e-prescription will be created and preparations
will be made for an accelerated, mandatory rollout in

2024.

� The existing funding programme for digital and technical
procurements in care facilities to relieve the burden on
nursing staff will be expanded to include additional
items in accordance with Article 8 (8) SGB XI.

� The Innovation Fund will be continued, further devel­

oped and enhanced. This will pave the way for innovative

forms of healthcare to be tested over time and trans­

ferred to everyday healthcare routine.


**Medium-term**


� All healthcare providers are required to connect to the
TI, and the capabilities for automated ePA filling will
be continually expanded (in the short-term, via the
electronic patient summary – ePKA).
� By 2027, at least 80 percent of laboratory results will be

stored in the ePA and can be forwarded to the Health

Data Lab (FDZ).
� The ePA will be further developed to enable algorithm/
AI-based healthcare interventions and public health

measures in real time.

� Procedure for low-threshold access to digital applica­
tions: After receiving detailed information on the
­potential risks, users can select the data security/data
protection level for authentication in digital apps. IT
security in healthcare and long-term care apps should
thus be simplified for first-time users. Awareness to
this issue must also be promoted.
� Develop simple, transparent opt-out solutions regarding
use of the ePA and a transparent and simplified ePA
authorisation management system that takes the insur­
ance holder’s perspective.

� Digitally assisted care documentation is to be used
across the board in day-to-day care and, in particular,

contribute to a noticeable reduction in the workload of
healthcare professionals and to their ­efficient use.


**Long-term**


� The ePA will perspectively be developed to become a
cross-Social Code portal, services (such as from health
and long-term care insurance, and from statutory
­pension and accident insurance) will be integrated, and
a joint database is to be created.

**“digital literacy and patient sovereignty”**
as important or very important.



(N=449)



The objectives, guidelines and measures outlined above are
designed to help strengthen patient sovereignty by enabling

informed, self-determined actions and decisions.


By means of the technologies and applications described,
all insurance holders and their family members will be given
the tools they need to codetermine and plot their course in
digitally assisted healthcare and long-term care. They will

receive relevant information, and be able to assess, under­

stand and communicate it to healthcare providers. Insurance
holders can actively exercise their right to portability and
interoperability of data that involves them and their health –
with help from others where needed. This improves access
to appropriate and necessary healthcare services. In the
­redesign of processes as described, it must be taken into
account that certain groups (such as people with relatively
poor digital affinity or digital health literacy) require tailored

services.


It is important that patients and people in need of longterm care can properly understand and classify health and
care data. Information must thus be prioritised and provided
in easy-to-understand form. And where needed, opportu­
nities for personal consultation and discussion must be
provided.



Representatives from healthcare and social welfare profes­
sions should also be supported in their decision-making
and actions – both in interdisciplinary constellations such as

councils and in additional use of healthcare data in the ePA.

They should also be given the tools they need to be able
to help other stakeholders in using digital applications,
thereby serving as facilitators.


**Discussion in the specialist forum on “Digital Literacy and**
**Patient Sovereignty”**
The gesund.bund.de portal could be further developed and
transformed into a health and care platform with intuitively
prepared and validated specialist information on illnesses
and diseases, treatments and (digital) support programmes
for insurance holders, their family members and health­
care providers. In the longer term, it could assume the
function of a trustworthy pilot to help users navigate their
way around the healthcare system. Interfaces with existing
platforms and portals containing support and healthcare

services are to be taken into account.

I. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES


Use of digital applications in health and care changes
­provision models and processes, and can ­require alignment
of the prevailing regulatory framework. The regulatory
framework should be designed in such a way that the
­objectives defined in the fields of action can be achieved.


II. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES


To achieve the objectives described, action and measures
will comply with the guidelines set out below:


� The regulatory framework is to be implemented with
clear provisions and rules, including standards, to enable
flexible response to digital developments and trends
and to ensure a sufficient degree of freedom in develop­
ing people-centric solutions in fair market competition
(striking a balance between competition and regulation).
� By means of a User Experience Design Lab (UX = User
Experience), the Digital Health Agency ensures that the
user perspective is ­taken into account when designing
TI applications. In addition, in specifications for TI
­applications, the user experience will become an integral
component of confirmation and approval procedures

for manufacturers.



� Uniform conditions will be created in which health and

care data can be used more quickly and more easily for
healthcare and healthcare research, both for the benefit
of patients and for the common good, while complying
with data protection and data security regulations.
� In the development and operation of digital applications
and infrastructures, funding aspects will be taken into
account. The emergence and maintenance of innova­
tion potential in Germany and Europe is supported and
promoted.
� At the same time, cost aspects and patient safety are
kept in mind and a balance is sought between quality,
cost-effectiveness and sustainability in the introduction
of digital applications and as well as in the replacement
of analogue solutions.
� Drive and actively shape EU-wide harmonisation of legal
and technical provisions in relation to digitalisation
of the health and care system (e.g. the EHDS, eIDAS/
Digital Identity).
� Promote and support competent development and
­expansion of harmonised digital infrastructures in the

various areas of healthcare.

� Monitor the impact of legal and regulatory measures
on the user-friendliness of digital applications and

­reduce bureaucratic obastcales.


##### **5.** Governance, Stakeholders, Responsibilities and Roles


As part of the digital transformation, existing responsi­
bilities and roles in health and care will need to change.
Some will be expanded or become more focused, while
others will disappear and new ones will emerge.


For example, patients and those in need of long-term care
can collect vital data themselves, regardless of time and
place, and specialised telemedicine providers can make
­diagnoses and issue electronic prescriptions. Such develop­
ments have an impact on how the stakeholders involved
see their purpose and roles. In some cases, this may result
in the need to evolve existing professional profiles and
­develop new ones – a process that must include dialogue

with the stakeholders involved.


Digitalisation is also giving rise to new models of stakeholder
collaboration, such as via platforms and portals, in ecosys­
tems and collaborative approaches. These developments
will be closely monitored, and those that prove useful, such
as the creation of ecosystems, will be encouraged and

­enabled.


In monitoring and managing both implementation and
continuous development and enhancement of the Digitali­
sation Strategy, transparent processes must be defined
which include clear responsibilities and roles.


The role of the Federal Ministry of Health is to assume
­responsibility for the Strategy’s further development, to
measure and evaluate progress, and derive concrete
measures from the results. The areas of responsibility for
the definition, integration and ensuring broad use of

­uniform technical and semantic standards will be described

in such a way as to enable the emergence and use of



digitally assisted healthcare solutions in the form of a
­cohesive, networked healthcare landscape.


The autonomy of the planned Digital Health Agency will be
strengthened by means of a completely new governance
approach.


The Agency is responsible for designing technical aspects
in the establishment of end-to-end processes. It creates
transparent, efficient, clear processes – such as for use in
drawing up specifications. The Agency is also responsible
for establishing strict approval procedures in relation to TI
applications and will have a mandate to define comprehen­
sive, binding interoperability requirements, and centrally
certify their implementation. The Digital Health Agency will
also have operational responsibility in the context of the
Digitalisation Strategy’s continuous development and en­

hancement.


The design of specific applications around the TI is carried
out in compliance with prevailing competitive market
standards and requirements, usually between providers in
the private sector. End users will be continuously and sys­
tematically involved in the evaluation and adaptation of
the respective applications as well as in implementation
projects.


Actual implementation of measures contained in a dedicated
implementation plan which is to be developed as needed
will be conducted wherever possible by individual system

stakeholders or in collaboration with several stakeholders

involved in or affected by the respective topic and where
the goal of overarching interoperability does not prevent it.


##### The Transformation Approach


##### **6.**


The digital transformation of health and care is both a top
priority and urgently needed. This makes its structured,
phased, but ambitious implementation and further devel­
opment essential.


The objectives set out in the earlier sections will thus be
transferred to an implementation plan, which will be regu­
larly evaluated and adapted as needed. In the Strategy’s
execution, state institutions, healthcare providers, health
and long-term insurance funds as well as other cost carriers
and private companies will assume their respective respon­
sibilities and roles in a targeted, solution-oriented ap­
proach.


Digitalisation of the health and care system system also
gives rise to ethical issues, not least those around dignity,
autonomy and self-determination of insurance holders.
This calls for social discourse on the question of how health
and care data and digital innovations should be used in a
legally sound, ethically justified way for the common good.
Focusing on human welfare as the ultimate benchmark, the

various issues involved must be in constant balance.


The ethical debate must not focus solely on possible risks.
Rather, it must be conducted as an open-ended deliberation
that also includes in the questions of which digitalisation
measures might be ethically necessary because their omis­
sion could endanger people’s health and lives in the short
or longer term. The Digitalisation Strategy is therefore in­

tended as a basis for this debate.


In order to prepare for important decisions, make respon­
sibilities and roles transparent, and ensure acceptance for
the transformation, patients, people in need of long-term
care, family members, service providers, the science com­
munity, the industrial healthcare economy, health and long
term ­insurance funds and other cost carriers must work

constructively together – for example in evaluating, further
developing and finalising measures, and in developing viable
funding models for necessary initial investment and to

cover operational costs. To facilitate collaboration, an
­ongoing format with working groups will be initiated. To
implement the Strategy, the working groups will identify
potential for improvement in associated processes and
technical conditions, and develop fitting solutions and
­approaches.


In the participative process used in the Strategy’s develop­
ment, the importance of satisfaction and acceptance
among all stakeholders and not least among end users has
emerged as a key success factor in achieving the digital
transformation. Satisfaction and acceptance can only be
promoted if measurable improvements in line with Strategy
goals and objectives are achieved and added value can be
experienced in a timely manner –through target groupspecific communication and interaction in the field as well
as broad-based integration into everyday practice. All
­implementation phases must therefore be accompanied
by a corresponding communications plan. Above all, this
should explain the advantages of digitalisation and the
­opportunities for self-determined use.


Organisations such as health and long-term care insurance
funds and other cost carriers, healthcare providers and
­patient interest groups, people in need of long-term care
and self-help groups assume an informational and naviga­
tional function for their members. Participatory approaches
such as living labs, model regions and pilot projects can
provide end users with low-threshold access to applications
so they can test and try them out. This is where planning
security for stakeholders is essential. Binding deadlines are
therefore to be set for trials of new technologies, applications
and processes via field tests, with realistic implementation
phases.

The Digitalisation Strategy initially defines short-term,
­medium-term and long-term measures to be implemented
in the fields of action of processes, data use, technologies
and applications. The basis for implementation is formed
by the associated implementation plans. Each field of action


is assigned a timeline, aim, responsibilities and roles. The
successes achieved in the course of implementation will be
evaluated as part of an ongoing process using suitable in­
struments, such as measuring the degree of digital maturity,
and – where appropriate – backed up by KPIs. Based on
regular reports from the working groups as well as national
and international policy, technology and social develop­
ments, the Strategy will be reviewed at two-year intervals
and, if needed, further developed and enhanced in a

­participative process.


**Learning from other countries**
Canada’s Drug and Health Technology Agency (CADTH), a
non-profit organisation, procvides objective data Canadian
decision-makers in the healthcare system. In doing so, it
considers the view of citizens in a variety of ways and
­involves them in healthcare decision-making. For example,
civil ­society is represented in bodies such as administrative
councils, committees, and annual consultative meetings,
and is involved in dialogue with the industry. CADTH also
­involves civil society in the evaluation of publicly funded
healthcare technologies to ensure both the relevance and
the quality of the technologies in question.


**Discussion in the specialist forum “Satisfaction and**
**­Acceptance among Insurance Holders”**
Support for family carers will be enabled by an optimal mix
of digital and analogue programmes. Courses on caregiving
skills, but also on improving personal well-being, including
relaxation techniques, are offered via an online platform.
Appropriate DiGAs and DiPAs are made available through
the platform. In addition, information on personal services
and support groups is provided.

DIGITALISATION STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT –


The Digitalisation Strategy for Health and Care was devel­
oped with the broad involvement of relevant stakeholders
from health and care, notably patients, ­representatives of
people in need of long-term care, family members, the
­science community, the industrial healthcare economy, the
public health service, health and long-term care insurance
funds and other cost carriers, and healthcare providers.
The public announcement for this participative process
was made in September 2022 with a kick-off event in Berlin,
which was attended by Federal Minister of Health Karl
Lauterbach. In parallel, intensive background talks were held
with experts from healthcare and from the worlds of

­system also had the opportunity to input their views and
expertise in a publicly accessible online survey. The out­
comes from the kick-off event, expert interviews and ­online
survey were further explored in eight topic-related specialist
forums attended by insurance holders and topic-related
experts from healthcare practice. After consolidating the
results, a second online stakeholder input process was
­conducted in which participants from the ­various partici­
pative formats were again able to provide feedback.
